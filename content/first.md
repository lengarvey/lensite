Typography is the foundation of web design. When done right, it becomes invisible, allowing readers to focus entirely on the content. This article explores how thoughtful typography choices can dramatically improve readability.

## The Elements of Readable Typography

 Good typography isn't just about choosing beautiful fonts.
 It's about creating a seamless reading experience through the thoughtful arrangement of text.
 The most readable designs consider these key elements:


* **Font selection** — Choosing typefaces that are clear and legible at various sizes
* **Line height** — Providing adequate spacing between lines (usually 1.5–1.6× the font size)
* **Line length** — Keeping lines to 60–75 characters for optimal readability
* **Color contrast** — Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background
* **Hierarchy** — Creating clear visual relationships between headings and body text

{% end %}

When these elements work together harmoniously, readers can process
            information with minimal cognitive strain. The best typography feels
            effortless, but it's actually the result of careful planning and
            attention to detail.
