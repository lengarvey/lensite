> If you had hoped that AI would launch your engineering career to the next level, be warned that it could do the opposite. LLMs can accelerate incompetence.
>
> If you're a skilled, experienced engineer and you fear that AI will make you unemployable, adopt a more nuanced view. LLMs can't replace human engineering.
>
> The business allure of AI is reduced costs through commoditized engineering, but just like offshore engineering talent brings forth mixed fruit, LLMs fall short and open risks.

> I am categorising my examples into 3 types of impact radius, AI missteps that:
>
> a. slowed down my speed of development and time to commit instead of speeding it up (compared to unassisted coding), or
> b. create friction for the team flow in that iteration, or
> c. negatively impact long-term maintainability of the code.

> The executives get excited. The consultants circle like sharks. PowerPoint decks multiply. Budgets shift.

> The most valuable skill in software isn't writing code, it's architecting systems.
